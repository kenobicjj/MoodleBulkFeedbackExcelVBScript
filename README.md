# MoodleBulkFeedbackExcelVBScript
Takes feedback comments from a range of cells in Excel, prints each cell to a separate pdf. The saving pattern follows that of Moodle bulk upload, with individual ranges for participant ID (and participant name for non-anonymous submission) generated. Once complete, zip the folders up and upload on Moodle.

Alter the ranges to fit your needs.

Comment out name if anonymous submission.

Not recommended to save as macro. Deploy as necessary by copy and paste onto your excel file. Press alt+11 to enter VB dev mode. Insert new module and paste this in.
